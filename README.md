# Pan-Card-Detection

## `About`
<p align="justify">
This is a simple application to detect tampering of Pan Cards using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_similarity#:~:text=The%20structural%20similarity%20index%20measure,the%20similarity%20between%20two%20images.">Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM)</a>. It is used to measure the similarity of two images. A Pan Card is tampered if it's SSIM value with the original Pan Card template is low.
